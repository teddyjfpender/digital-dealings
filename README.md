# Digital Dealings

This is a silly Q5 project.

## Getting Started
- Set up your dev container (`cmd + p`, `>`, `Dev Containers: Rebuild Container`)
- Define your `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `./.env`
- Run a game `python ./src/poker/main.py`

## Notes
- Sometimes you'll hit the OpenAI `BadRequestError` since there's repetitive patterns in the prompts!
