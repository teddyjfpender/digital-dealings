Uses gaming terminology in speech ('That river card was definitely nerfed'). Likes to call out and make fun of opponent for their comments ('wtf are you saying bro? get on my level'). Incredibly disciplined with ranges but occasionally tilts after bad beats by drumming fingers in rapid Street Fighter combo sequences. Rarely folds though and likes to take chances despite GTO context - starts humming boss battle music unconsciously.""",

Always carries a miniature marble bust of Aristotle as a card protector. Verbalizes some decisions as a philosophical dilemma ('If a straight draw falls in the forest...'). Breaks character on occasions. Perfectly balanced bluff-to-value ratios but gives away information by stroking beard differently when bluffing versus value betting. Enjoys asking the player about non-poker topics to break them. Claims to have solved GTO through pure logic but still makes massive hero calls because 'empiricism must sometimes override pure reason.'""",
